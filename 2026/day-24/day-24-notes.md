# 📘 Day 24 – Advanced Git: Merge, Rebase, Stash & Cherry Pick

---

# 1️⃣ Git Merge

## 🔹 What is Merge?

Merge combines changes from one branch into another.

It preserves commit history and does NOT rewrite commits.

---

## 🔹 Fast-Forward Merge

Happens when the target branch has not moved ahead.

Example:

A → B → C (feature)  
      ↑  
    master  

After merge:

A → B → C (master)

✔ Git simply moves the branch pointer forward  
✔ No merge commit created  

---

## 🔹 Merge Commit

Happens when both branches moved separately (diverged).

Example before merge:

        C → D (feature)
       /
A → B → E (master)

After merge:

        C → D
       /      \
A → B → E ---- M

✔ Git creates a merge commit (M)  
✔ History of both branches is preserved  

---

## 🔹 What is a Merge Conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when:

- The same file  
- Same line  
- Modified differently in two branches  

Git cannot decide automatically.

To resolve:

1. Open the conflicted file  
2. Remove conflict markers:
   "<<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>"  
3. Keep correct content  
4. Run:
   git add <file>
5. Complete merge or rebase  

---

# 2️⃣ Git Rebase

## 🔹 What is Rebase?

Rebase takes feature branch commits and replays them on top of another branch.

It rewrites history by creating new commit hashes.

---

## 🔹 What Rebase Actually Does

Before rebase:

        C → D (feature)
       /
A → B → E (master)

After rebase:

A → B → E → C' → D'

✔ History becomes linear  
✔ No merge commit  
✔ Commit hashes change  

---

## 🔹 Why Do Commit Hashes Change?

Commit hash depends on:

- Parent commit  
- Content  
- Metadata  

If parent changes → hash changes.

Rebase recreates commits → new hashes are generated.

---

## 🔹 Why Rebase is Dangerous on Shared Branches

Rebase rewrites history.

If a branch was already pushed and teammates pulled it:

- Their history will differ  
- Push requires force push  
- Causes confusion and conflicts  

---

## 🔹 When to Use Rebase

✔ On local feature branch  
✔ Before merging to keep history clean  
✔ When working alone  

---

## 🔹 When NOT to Use Rebase

❌ On shared master/main branch  
❌ On production branches  
❌ On branches already used by team  

---

# 3️⃣ Squash Merge

## 🔹 What is Squash Merge?

Combines multiple commits into a single commit before merging.

Example:

Feature branch commits:
- Fix typo  
- Update spacing  
- Add validation  

After squash merge:

One clean commit added to master.

---

## 🔹 Trade-off

✔ Cleaner history  
❌ Lose individual commit details  

---

# 4️⃣ Git Stash

## 🔹 What is Stash?

Temporarily saves uncommitted changes so you can switch branches safely.

---

## 🔹 Useful Commands

Save changes:
git stash

List stashes:
git stash list

Apply without deleting:
git stash apply

Apply and remove:
git stash pop

---

## 🔹 When to Use Stash

✔ Urgent branch switch  
✔ Mid-work interruption  
✔ Hotfix situation  

---

# 5️⃣ Cherry Pick

## 🔹 What is Cherry Pick?

Applies a specific commit from one branch onto another.

Command:
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

---

## 🔹 When to Use

✔ Apply specific hotfix  
✔ Select only one change from feature branch  
✔ Avoid merging entire branch  

---

## 🔹 Risks

❌ Duplicate commits  
❌ Conflicts  
❌ Confusing history if overused  

---

# 🧠 Key Mental Model Learned

- Git is a tree of commits  
- A branch is just a pointer to a commit  
- Merge preserves history  
- Rebase rewrites history  
- Commit hash changes if parent changes  
- Use rebase only on private branches  

---

# 🎯 Personal Reflection

Today I experienced:

- Real rebase conflict  
- Commit hash changes  
- History rewriting  
- Graph confusion and clarity  

Now I understand:

Merge = Safe and preserves history  
Rebase = Clean history but risky on shared branches
